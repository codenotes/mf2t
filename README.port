Installation
────────────

You will need the libmidifile library, which can be found at
http://matsp888.no-ip.org/software/winunix/lib/libmidifile/.  Run ‘make’
and ‘make install’ to install it.  It will be placed in $HOME/lib and
$HOME/include.

Run ‘make’ to compile the programs.  Run ‘make install’ to install the
resulting executables into $HOME/bin.

The original, unmodified source code is in the ‘orig’ directory.
