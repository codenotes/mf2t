Overview
────────

This library provides functions for reading and writing standard MIDI
files.  It was originally written by Tim Thompson <tjt@nosuch.com>.  It
has been modified and corrected by Piet van Oostrum <piet@cs.uu.nl>.  I
have made some minor changes to it in order to work properly with GCC.


Installation
────────────

Run ‘make’ to compile the library.  Run ‘make install’ to install the
library and header file into $HOME/lib and $HOME/include.


Usage
─────

Please see the file ‘midifile.txt’ for a description of the library and
its functions.  Some parts may be outdated, since Piet van Oostrum
<piet@cs.uu.nl> has made some changes and corrections to the source
code.
